# Country Currency and Exchange API üåç

## Overview
This is a robust RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that efficiently fetches comprehensive country data, including currency and exchange rates, from external sources. It persists this data in a MySQL database and provides powerful CRUD operations, filtering, and dynamic summary generation.

## Features
- **External Data Integration**: Fetches detailed country information from `restcountries.com` and real-time exchange rates from `open.er-api.com`.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores and manages country data efficiently using a MySQL relational database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides endpoints for creating (refreshing), reading (listing and by name), and deleting country records.
- **Data Filtering & Sorting**: Allows filtering countries by `region` and `currency`, and sorting by `estimated_gdp` in ascending or descending order.
- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Creates a summary image displaying total countries, last refresh timestamp, and top 5 countries by estimated GDP.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements middleware for effective error handling, including 404 Not Found and internal server errors.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Organized into controllers, services, routes, and middleware for maintainability and scalability.

## Getting Started
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Installation
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dprof-code/country-currency-and-exchange-api.git
    cd country-currency-and-exchange-api
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Database Setup**:
    *   Ensure you have a MySQL server running.
    *   Create a database named `country_db`. The application will handle table creation and updates on the first data refresh.

```
PORT=8000
host=localhost
user=your_mysql_username
password=your_mysql_password
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Usage
Once the API is running, you can interact with it using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl`.

1.  **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on `http://localhost:8000` (or your configured `PORT`).

2.  **Refresh Country Data**:
    To populate your database with initial data or update existing data, send a `POST` request:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/countries/refresh
    ```

3.  **View All Countries**:
    Retrieve a list of all countries:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/countries
    ```

4.  **Filter and Sort Countries**:
    Get countries in Europe, sorted by GDP descending:
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:8000/countries?region=Europe&sort=gdp_desc"
    ```
    Get countries using USD currency:
    ```bash
    curl "http://localhost:8000/countries?currency=USD"
    ```

5.  **Get a Specific Country**:
    Retrieve data for a country by its name (ensure proper URL encoding for names with spaces):
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/countries/Germany
    # For names with spaces:
    curl http://localhost:8000/countries/United%20States
    ```

6.  **Delete a Country**:
    Remove a country record from the database:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/countries/Canada
    ```

7.  **Check API Status**:
    Get a summary of total countries and last refresh timestamp:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/status
    ```

8.  **Retrieve Summary Image**:
    Access the generated image summarizing country statistics:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/countries/image --output summary.png
    ```
    This will save the image to `summary.png` in your current directory.
